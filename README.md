# CASE Front-end starters

This repo features CASE starters with popular front-end frameworks.

The example app is a virtual Pokedex where you can see and create Pokemon.

## How to use ?

First of all launch the CASE backend:

```
cd case
npm i
npm start
```

Once done you can seed the initial list of Pokemon:

```
npm run seed
```

Then `cd` into your favorite front-end and run:

```
npm i
npm start
```
